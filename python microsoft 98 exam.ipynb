    "# Introduction\n",
    "Type represents the kind of value and determines how the value can be used. All data values in Python are encapsulated in relevant object classes. Everything in Python is an object and every object has an identity, a type, and a value. Like another object-oriented language such as Java or C++, there are several data types which are built into Python. Extension modules which are written in C, Java, or other languages can define additional types.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine a variable's type in Python you can use the type() function. The value of some objects can be changed. Objects whose value can be changed are called mutable and objects whose value is unchangeable (once they are created) are called immutable. Here are the details of Python data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers\n",
    "Numbers are created by numeric literals. Numeric objects are immutable, which means when an object is created its value cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. Integers represent negative and positive integers without fractional parts whereas floating point numbers represents negative and positive numbers with fractional parts. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of plain integers. See the following statements in Python shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python integer float example\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a complex number (generally used in engineering) is a number of the form A+Bi where i is the imaginary number. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part. Python supports complex numbers either by specifying the number in (real + imagJ) or (real + imagj) form or using a built-in method complex(x, y). See the following statements in Python Shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Complex Number\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean (bool)\n",
    "The simplest build-in type in Python is the bool type, it represents the truth values False and True. See the following statements in Python shell.\n",

    "Python Boolean Type\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings\n",
    "In Python, a string type object is a sequence (left-to- right order) of characters. Strings start and end with single or double quotes Python strings are immutable. Single and double quoted strings are same and you can use a single quote within a string when it is surrounded by double quote and vice versa. Declaring a string is simple, see the following statements.\n",

    "\n",
    "String Slicing\n",
    "To cut a substring from a string is called string slicing. Here two indices are used separated by a colon (:). A slice 3:7 means indices characters of 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th positions. The second integer index i.e. 7 is not included. You can use negative indices for slicing. See the following statements.\n",

    "List indices work the same way as string indices, list indices start at 0. If an index has a positive value it counts from the beginning and similarly it counts backward if the index has a negative value. As positive integers are used to index from the left end and negative integers are used to index from the right end, so every item of a list gives two alternatives indices. Let create a list called color_list with four items.\n",

    "List Slices\n",
    "Lists can be sliced like strings and other sequences. The syntax of list slices is easy :\n",
    "sliced_list = List_Name[startIndex:endIndex]\n",
    "This refers to the items of a list starting at index startIndex and stopping just before index endIndex. The default values for list are 0 (startIndex) and the end (endIndex) of the list. If you omit both indices, the slice makes a copy of the original list. See the following statements.\n",

The items in a dictionary are a comma-separated list of key:value pairs where keys and values are Python data type. Each object or value accessed by key and keys are unique in the dictionary. As keys are used for indexing, they must be the immutable type (string, number, or tuple). You can create an empty dictionary using empty curly braces\n",
